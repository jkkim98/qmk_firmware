# jkkim98's Lily58 Pro Keymap

Used the default keymap for some time but realised I could probably get away with less keys... So bought Corne. While that's being shipped, to use in the meantime and get used to 3 x 6, copied bcat's keymap with some modification.

- Shifted the arrow keys one key right, like the default keymap, instead of the Vim style
  - Annoyed at having to shift all four fingers a key left to use the arrow keys when they could be under the finger's default placement
- Stop using the outer thumb keys
  - To match Corne and they're hard to reach
- Remove page down/up keys
  - They have too much effect
- Include backspace, delete, tab, and escape in the other layers for quick editing
